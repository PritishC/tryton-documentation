Using the Tryton Desktop Client
===============================

Tryton is an desktop-client application. That means that we need to know the
server url and port to connect to it. We also need to know the database on we
will work. There is also the possibility to create a new database if needed.

Getting the Tryton Desktop Client
---------------------------------

The desktop client can be downloaded from the `downloads page
<http://www.tryton.org/download.html>`_ of the Tryton website.

.. warning:: To be able to connect to a server you must use a client version
             of the same series as server. So if your server is series 3.0
             you must use 3.0 series client.

Connecting to your server
-------------------------

The first time you open the tryton client you will see the following screen.

.. figure:: images/tryton-login.png

   Tryton's client login window

In this window you can enter the connection params of your server:

* *yourserver*: It's your server URL. Something like demo.tryton.org
* *port*: It's the port where your server is running. The default value is 8000
* *database*: It's the name of the database you will work on.
* *user*: Introduce the username you want to use for connecting.
* *password*: Introduce you password to connect to the server.

Managing profiles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The tryton client has the hability of managing connection profiles, so you only
have to introduce the servers details only one time. If you click the
`Manage Profiles` button you will see the following screen:

.. figure:: images/tryton-profile.png

   Tryton connection profiles.


In the left part of the screen you will see all the available profiles. You can
add a new one by using the `Add` button. You also can delete old profiles with
the `Remove` button. Use the right part of the screen to modify current
profiles or to add the details of new created profiles.

The client will try to connect to the server to load the databases and show
they on the dropdown. It will fail if you can't connect to the server.

You can open the tryton client the number of times you want. This is usefull
when you need to access diferent servers or databases in the same time.

Password window
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For security reasons the client will ask you to enter your password if you have
not had any activity in a period of time.

Searching
---------

A query is composed of search clauses. A clause is composed of a field name
(with : at the end), an operator and a value. The field name is optional and
defaults to the record name. The operator is also optional and defaults to
a case insensitive search on the name of the record.

Examples:

mich

.. image:: images/search-mich.png
   :align: center


Name: Michael


.. image:: images/search-michael.png
   :align: center



Operators
``````````

The following operators can be used:

 * =: equal to
 * <: less then
 * <=: less then or equal to
 * >: greater then
 * >=: greater then or equal to
 * !=: not equal
 * !: not equal or not like (depending of the type of field)

For example: Name: != Dwight


Wildcards
`````````

There are two wildcards:

%: matches any string of zero or more characters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: images/search-with-percentage.png
   :align: center

'_': matches any single character
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: images/search-with-underscore.png
   :align: center

It is possible to escape special characters in values by using double quotes.
For example: Name: "Michael:Scott"
Here it will search with the value Michael:Scott.


Clause composition
``````````````````

The clauses can be composed using the two boolean operators `and` and `or`.
By default, there is an implicit `and` between each clause if no operator is
specified.

For example::

    Name: Michael Amount: 100

is the same as::

    Name: Michael and Amount: 100


Example using `or`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: images/search-with-or.png
   :align: center


The `and` operator has a highest precedence than or but you can change
it by using parenthesis.

For example::

    (Name: Michael or Name: Pam) and Amount: 100

is different than::

    Name: Michael or Name: Pam and Amount: 100

which is evaluated as::

    Name: Michael or (Name: Pam and Amount: 100)

  the refresh button to reload server values.
